# About
G.A.L (Gamers As Legions) System Optimizer
What is G.A.L?
G.A.L, short for Gamers As Legions, is a system optimization tool designed specifically for gamers and power users who want to squeeze every last drop of performance out of their Windows PC. It’s like a swiss army knife for system maintenance, cleaning up junk files, optimizing settings, and ensuring your rig is running at peak performance. Whether you're battling in a high-stakes esports match or exploring vast open worlds, G.A.L ensures your system is free of clutter and optimized for maximum responsiveness.

What does G.A.L do?
G.A.L performs a series of cleaning and optimization tasks to free up system resources, reduce latency, and improve overall performance. Here’s a breakdown of what it does:

Clean RAM Cache:

Clears out unused RAM, freeing up memory for your games and applications.

This is like giving your system a fresh breath of air, ensuring no background processes are hogging your precious RAM.

Clean Windows Temp Folder:

Deletes temporary files from the C:\Windows\Temp folder.

These files are often leftovers from installations or updates and can pile up over time, taking up valuable disk space.

Clean Prefetch Folder:

Clears out the C:\Windows\Prefetch folder, which stores preloaded data to speed up application launches.

Over time, this folder can become bloated with outdated data, and cleaning it can help improve boot times.

Clean Recycle Bin:

Empties the Recycle Bin for all users, freeing up disk space.

No more forgotten files taking up space on your SSD or HDD.

Clean Windows Update Cache:

Deletes the cache from C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download.

This is where Windows stores update files, and clearing it can resolve update-related issues and free up space.

Clean Temporary Internet Files:

Removes cached files from your browser’s temporary internet files folder.

This helps free up space and can improve browser performance.

Clean Thumbnails:

Deletes thumbnail caches, which are used to speed up the display of images and videos in File Explorer.

Over time, these caches can grow large and become outdated.

Clean Delivery Optimization Files:

Removes files used by Windows Update’s Delivery Optimization feature, which shares updates with other PCs over the internet.

This can free up space and reduce unnecessary network usage.

Clean Temp Folder:

Clears out the %temp% folder for all users, which stores temporary files created by applications.

This is a common source of disk clutter.

Flush DNS Cache:

Clears the DNS cache, which can resolve connectivity issues and improve network performance.

Essential for gamers who rely on low-latency connections.

Set Cloudflare DNS:

Configures your system to use Cloudflare’s fast and privacy-focused DNS servers (1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1).

This can improve internet speed and reduce latency in online games.

Set Ultimate Power Plan:

Activates the Ultimate Performance power plan, which maximizes system performance by prioritizing speed over energy savings.

Perfect for gaming rigs where every frame counts.

Install.bat
What is Install.bat?
Install.bat is a batch script that ensures your system has everything it needs to run G.A.L. It checks for the necessary software and libraries, and if they’re missing, it guides you through the installation process.

What does Install.bat do?

Checks for Python:

Python is required to run the G.A.L script. The script checks if Python is installed on your system.

If Python is missing, it prompts you to install it before proceeding.

Checks for pip:

pip is Python’s package manager, used to install third-party libraries. The script ensures pip is installed.

If pip is missing, it advises you to install it.

Installs Required Libraries:

G.A.L relies on the psutil library to perform tasks like cleaning RAM. The script automatically installs psutil using pip.

If the installation fails (e.g., due to no internet connection), it notifies you and exits.
